# Machine Learning Project Implementation Using AWS Sagemaker

This project demonstrates how to train a Machine Learning model using Amazon Sagemaker.
The objective is to generate a model capable of predicting the total weight of an airplane before takeoff ("PesoTotalTARGET"). To achieve this, I have a list of completed flights along with a series of relevant variables.

  !! Considerations:
  
  Overfitting: Perfect performance can be a sign of overfitting, especially if the training data is limited or if the model is complex. It is advisable to evaluate the model with an additional validation set or to perform cross-validation.

# Notes:
Train.csv contains the original dataset, before adapting the data to a normalized format.

test-V-1 and train-V-1 contain the normalized information used to train the ML model.

model.tar.gz contains the trained model, ready to be deployed.
